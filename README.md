Filling a SVG for US Counties using colors generated from Unemployement Stats for 2013. Got the SVG from wikipedia. Separated and modified the path variable in the SVG using a python script. Decided the color to fill using the unemployement data retireved from US census.

USA.svg is the filled in svg. Can be downloaded and viewed.
